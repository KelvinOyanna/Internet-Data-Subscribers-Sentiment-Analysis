# Internet-Data-Subscribers-Sentiment-Analysis
The goal of this project is to understand subscribersâ€™ preferences as well as their positive or negative sentiments about internet service providers in Nigeria. The data for the analysis is majorly scraped from twitter via Twitter API and Tweepy (Python library for accessing twitter data).  Other tools used includes Natural Language tool kit (nltk) for tokenizing tweets and StreamListener for scheduling and downloading tweets in real-time. The project is currently on-going, while allowing for collection of a robust data set.
